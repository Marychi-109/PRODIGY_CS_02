Pixel Manipulation Project

Overview

This project demonstrates various image manipulation techniques using Python and the Pillow library. It allows users to enhance and transform images through different methods, including color inversion, brightness adjustment, blurring, resizing, and more.

Features

- **Color Inversion:** Flips the colors of the image.
- **Brightness Adjustment:** Enhances the brightness of the image.
- **Blurring:** Applies Gaussian blur to soften the image.
- **Resizing:** Resizes the image to a specified dimension.
- **Rotating:** Rotates the image by a specified angle.
- **Thresholding:** Converts the image to black and white.
- **Drawing Shapes:** Draws geometric shapes on the image.
- **Pixelation:** Creates a pixelated effect for artistic transformation.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel_manipulation.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pixel_manipulation
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. Update the `image_path` variable in `pixel_manipulation.py` with the path to your input image.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pixel_manipulation.py
   ```
3. The manipulated images will be saved in the same directory as the script.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to set the image path in the script:

```python
image_path = r'C:\Users\HP\Pictures\your_image.png'  # Change to your input image path
```
